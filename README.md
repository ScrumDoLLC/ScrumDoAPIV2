ScrumDo API Version 2
============

Beta Status
============

This version of the API is currently in Beta status, and is only available on the ScrumDo Beta server.  
Make sure all references to URL's are to beta.scrumdo.com, and not www.scrumdo.com, no matter what this
document says.  

Take Care: The beta server points to the live production database, so you'll be dealing with your live projects.
